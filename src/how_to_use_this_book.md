# How to use this book

> 10. Get into a rut early: Do the same process the same way. Accumulate idioms.

—Alan Perlis, Epigrams on Programming

The goal of this book is to make programming in Rust less frustrating for C++
programmers by providing translations of common C++ idioms and patterns into
idiomatic Rust, along with explanations of the reasons for and engineering
trade-offs with the differences.

The translations are often not straightforward transliterations, but rather are
more comprehensive changes of to how to approach, using stable Rust, the kinds
of problems that the C++ idioms and patterns are intended to address.

The book is structured to make it possible to read it front-to-back. Ideally,
after reading this book, one's "idiom list" for Rust should be significantly
more fleshed out, leading to a more enjoyable and productive experience
programming in Rust.

The chapters are also organized around C++ concepts instead of Rust concepts, to
aid C++ programmers in finding a specific solution to a problem in terms that
will be natural to them while they are learning Rust.

## Other resources

If you are not primarily a C or C++ programmer, [The Rust Programming
Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) may be a better starting point.

If you are primarily an embedded systems programmer using C or C++, this book is
a complement to [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/).
